## Summary ## 
Based off of the key bulleted information, the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Now, I was focused more on the "average(mean)" temperature. Reason being, it gives an overall picture what the tempratures are like in the hottest month(June) and the coolest month(December). When we look at December we can see that their coldest day can drop as low as 56 degrees, which is really cold! But, on average the temperature is 71 degress. So, if the coldest month is in the 70's we are in the clear. Now, if I would recommend gathering more data for both months. One point of information I would like to gather information on is precipitation; how many times does it rain in both months? Next, I would like to know the "Feels like" temperature data. In other words, sometimes, it may be 74 degrees, but it might feel like its 80 degrees or vice versa. I recommend running a query on "precipication" and "Feels like" to create a more well rounded picture of the Surfs Up shop's sustainability.
