# Overview #

W.Avy may want to invest in a Surf shop that also sells ice cream. W. Avy requested additonal information about temperature trends from me. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. It is of utmost importance that I provide the necesscary information so that W.Avy can make a much more accurate decision for possible investment. The information provided below should provide more clarity.

## Summary ## 

Based off of the key bulleted information, the SurfsUp ice cream shop business is **sustainable year-round**. Now, I focused more on the "average(mean)" temperature. Reason being, it gives an **overall** picture of what the tempratures are like in the **hottest month(June)** and the **coolest month(December)**. When we look at December we can see that their coldest day can drop as low as 56 degrees, which is really cold! But, on average the temperature is 71 degress. So, if the coldest month is in the 70's we are in the clear. Now, I would recommend gathering more data for both months. One point of information I would like to gather information on is **precipitation**; how many times does it rain in both months? Next, I would like to know the **"Feels like"** temperature data. In other words, sometimes, it may be 74 degrees, but it might feel like its 80 degrees or vice versa. I recommend running a query on "precipication" and "Feels like" to create a more well rounded picture of the Surfs Up shop's sustainability.
